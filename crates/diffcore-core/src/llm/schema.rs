You MUST include exactly these 5 criteria in the 'criteria' array:

2. review_ordering: Is the suggested review order logical? Are high-risk, foundational changes reviewed first?
3. entrypoint_identification: Are HTTP routes, CLI commands, queue consumers, and other entrypoints correctly identified?
4. risk_reasonableness: Are risk scores sensible? Do auth/schema changes score higher than utility changes?
5. mermaid_accuracy: Does the Mermaid graph accurately represent the data flow between files in each group?"#

Guidelines:
- Only suggest operations where the deterministic grouping is clearly wrong
- Splits: use when a group contains logically unrelated changes (e.g., a refactor mixed with a feature)
- Merges: use when separate groups are actually part of the same logical change (e.g., scattered refactor)
- Re-ranks: use when semantic review ordering differs from risk-based ordering (e.g., schema should be reviewed before handler)
- Reclassifications: use when static reachability assigned a file to the wrong group
- If no refinements are needed, return empty arrays for all operations
- Every file mentioned in splits/reclassifications must exist in the original groups
- Group names MUST be descriptive: e.g. 'media asset upload pipeline' not 'page test flow'. Names should describe the domain/feature and the nature of the change

ID fields — STRICT:
- `source_group_id`, `group_ids`, `from_group_id`, and `to_group_id` MUST be literal group IDs (e.g. `group_1`, `group_2`) from the input, or the literal string `infrastructure`.
- NEVER use a group's descriptive name (`name` field) in an ID position. IDs and names are different fields.
- If you want to route a file to a newly-created group, create that group via a `split` operation — do NOT invent a new ID in `to_group_id`.
