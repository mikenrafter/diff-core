# diffcore — Specification

## Context

When AI agents modify 50–100 files in a single PR, existing diff tools (VS Code, Beyond Compare, GitHub) present changes as a flat file list. This forces reviewers to mentally reconstruct data flow, architectural impact, and causal ordering — the most cognitively expensive part of code review.

**diffcore** solves this by transforming flat file diffs into ranked, semantically grouped review flows. It answers: "what changed, in what order should I review it, and how does data flow through the changes?"

Two modes:
- **Deterministic**: static analysis only — graph construction, flow grouping, ranking
- **LLM-annotated**: reasoning models narrate over the deterministic graph (BYOK)

## 1. Product Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | `diffcore` |
| Language | Rust |
| UIs | Tauri desktop app + VS Code extension |
| Target user | Solo developer (James), architect for eventual open-source |
| License | TBD |

### Problem Statement

AI coding agents produce large, semantically entangled diffs. Current diff tools show **ΔF = {changed files}** — an unordered set. Humans need **ranked paths through a dependency graph G** — ordered sequences that follow data flow, not filesystem structure.

### Core Insight

Diff review is a **graph problem**, not a **set problem**. The right primitive is not "file A changed" but "request enters here → transformed here → validated here → persisted here → emitted here → rendered here."

### Component Responsibilities

**Rust Core (CLI + library)**
- All analysis logic lives here — single source of truth
- Exposes both CLI interface and library API (for Tauri)
- Stateless per invocation (no daemon required for v1)

**Tauri App**
- Three-panel layout: flow groups | Monaco diff viewer | annotations/graph
- Calls Rust core directly via Tauri commands (no CLI subprocess)
- Renders Mermaid diagrams for flow visualization

**VS Code Extension**
- Thin TypeScript shell
- Spawns `diffcore` CLI binary, parses JSON output
- Renders results in webviews and tree views
- Opens VS Code's native diff editor for file-level review

## 3. Diff Input Sources

All input is git-based. Four modes:

| Mode | CLI Flag | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| PR preview (default) | `--pr` or no flags | Merge-base diff: `main...HEAD` — shows everything on this branch that's ahead of main. The "what would my PR look like?" mode. Auto-detects current branch and default branch |
| Branch comparison | `--base main --head feature` | Compare two refs |
| Commit range | `--range HEAD~5..HEAD` | Review a range of commits |
| Working tree | `--staged` / `--unstaged` | Review uncommitted changes |

Implementation: `git2` crate for all git operations. No shelling out to `git`. PR preview mode uses `git2::Repository::merge_base()` to find the common ancestor, then diffs from there to HEAD.

## 4. Analysis Pipeline

### 4.1 Diff Extraction

```
git diff → list of (file_path, old_content, new_content, hunks)
```

For each changed file, extract:
- File path (old and new, handling renames)
- Full old/new content for AST parsing
- Hunk-level changes for precise change localization

### 4.2 AST Parsing (Tree-sitter)

Parse both old and new versions of each changed file using tree-sitter.

Tree-sitter supports 100+ languages via community grammars. No language-specific code needed for basic AST extraction.

Extract from each file:
- **Definitions**: functions, classes, structs, interfaces, type aliases, constants
- **Imports/exports**: what each file depends on and provides
- **Call expressions**: which functions are called and where
- **Changed symbols**: which definitions were added/modified/removed

### 4.3 Symbol Graph Construction (petgraph)

Build a directed graph `G = (V, E)` where:

**Vertices (V)**: symbols (functions, classes, types, modules)

**Edges (E)** with types:
- `imports(A, B)` — A imports from B
- `calls(A, B)` — function A calls function B
- `extends(A, B)` — class/type A extends B
- `instantiates(A, B)` — A creates an instance of B
- `reads(A, D)` — function A reads from data source D
- `writes(A, D)` — function A writes to data source D
- `emits(A, E)` — function A emits event E
- `handles(A, E)` — function A handles event E

### 4.4 Full Data Flow Tracing

Go beyond import graphs — trace how data moves through the system:

**Static tracing:**
- Follow function parameters and return types across call chains
- Track variable assignments that flow into function calls
- Resolve type signatures to connect producers and consumers

**Heuristic inference:**
- If function A calls function B and B contains a DB write pattern (e.g., `.save()`, `.insert()`, `INSERT INTO`), mark edge as `persistence`
- If a function matches HTTP handler patterns (decorators, router registrations), mark as `entrypoint`
- If a function publishes to a queue/event bus, mark as `emission`
- If a function reads from env/config, mark as `configuration`

**Framework pattern detection (optional, auto-detected):**
- Express/Fastify/Next.js route handlers
- FastAPI/Flask/Django view functions
- React component trees and prop drilling
- Prisma/SQLAlchemy/TypeORM model usage
- Message queue producers/consumers
- Effect.ts `HttpApi`/`HttpApiEndpoint`/`HttpApiGroup` routes, `Layer`/`Effect.Service`/`Context.Tag` services, `@effect/sql` Drizzle integration, `@effect/cli` commands

### 4.5 Entrypoint Detection

Automatically detect entry points into the application via three mechanisms:

**Call-site detection** — pattern-match explicit framework API calls in the AST:

| Type | Detection heuristic |
|------|-------------------|
| HTTP routes | Decorator patterns, router registrations, file-based routing |
| HTTP routes (Effect.ts) | `HttpApi`, `HttpApiEndpoint`, `HttpApiGroup`, `HttpRouter`, `HttpServer` patterns |
| CLI commands | `main()`, argument parser setup, `bin` entries |
| CLI commands (Effect.ts) | `@effect/cli` `Command`, `Args`, `Options` patterns |
| Queue consumers | Message handler registrations, subscriber patterns |
| Queue consumers (Effect.ts) | Effect `Queue`, `PubSub` consumer patterns |
| Cron jobs | Scheduler registrations, cron expressions |
| Cron jobs (Effect.ts) | Effect `Schedule`, `@effect/cron` patterns |
| React pages | Default exports from page/route directories |
| Test files | Test function/describe block patterns |
| Test files (Effect.ts) | `@effect/vitest` `it.effect`, `it.scoped`, `describe` patterns |
| Event handlers | Event listener registrations |
| Event handlers (Effect.ts) | Effect `Stream`, `PubSub`, `Hub` listener patterns |
| Effect.ts Services | `Effect.Service`, `Context.Tag`, `Layer` definitions — primary service/DI entrypoints |

**Path-based detection (Tier 1)** — if the file path matches route/handler/controller/command directory or filename patterns AND the file imports from a known web/CLI framework, all exported/public functions become entrypoints. Works across all 14 supported languages with per-language framework import tables. Directory patterns: `/routes/`, `/handlers/`, `/controllers/`, `/endpoints/`, `/commands/`, `/cmd/`, `/cli/`. File patterns: `*.routes.*`, `*.handler.*`, `*.controller.*`, `*.endpoint.*`, `*.command.*`, `*.cli.*`.

**Path-based detection (Tier 2)** — very strong path signals detect entrypoints even without a framework import check. This catches files where the import came from an unchanged transitive dependency. Strong signals: files containing `entrypoint`/`entrypoints` in name, `server.*`/`app.*` at project root, files in `/commands/` or `/cmd/` directories.

See [improved-clustering.md §1](./improved-clustering.md) for the full path pattern and framework import tables.

### 4.6 Semantic Clustering

Group changed files into "flow groups" — sets of files that participate in the same logical data flow.

**Algorithm:**

1. For each detected entrypoint in the changed set, compute **bidirectional reachability** in graph G:
   - **Forward BFS** (`Direction::Outgoing`, cost-per-hop=1) — follows calls/imports downstream from the entrypoint
   - **Reverse BFS** (`Direction::Incoming`, cost-per-hop=2) — follows edges upstream to find files that depend on the entrypoint's group
   - Merge: keep the minimum distance for each file across both passes
2. Intersect each reachability set with the changed file set ΔF
3. Files reachable from the same entrypoint and in ΔF belong to the same flow group
4. Files reachable from multiple entrypoints get assigned to the group where they have the shortest path distance (forward edges always win due to lower cost)
5. Ungrouped files (not reachable from any entrypoint) are classified into infrastructure sub-groups:
   - **Convention-based**: true infrastructure (Docker, CI/CD, env, configs), schemas, scripts, migrations, deployment, documentation, lint configs, test utilities, generated code
   - **Import-edge clustering**: remaining files connected by graph edges form component groups
   - **Directory proximity**: files sharing a directory prefix (≥2 files) form directory groups
   - **Fallback**: anything left goes to "Unclassified"

The reverse BFS cost=2 ensures forward-reachable files are always preferred for group assignment while preventing reverse-reachable files from being dumped into infrastructure. See [improved-clustering.md §2-3](./improved-clustering.md) for details.

**Output:** `FlowGroup[]` where each group has:
- `id: string`
- `name: string` (auto-generated, e.g., "POST /api/users handler chain")
- `entrypoint: Symbol | null`
- `files: FileChange[]` (ordered by flow position)
- `edges: Edge[]` (internal edges within the group)
- `risk_score: f64`

### 4.7 Review Ranking

Rank flow groups for review order using a composite score:

```
score(group) = w₁·risk + w₂·centrality + w₃·surface_area + w₄·uncertainty
```

Where:
- **risk** = schema changes, public API changes, auth/security-related, DB migrations → higher risk
- **centrality** = PageRank or betweenness centrality of changed nodes in G → more central = review first
- **surface_area** = number of changed lines / files in the group
- **uncertainty** = inverse of test coverage overlap, number of heuristic (vs static) edges

Within each group, files are ordered by **flow position** — entrypoint first, then downstream in data flow order.

Default weights: `w₁=0.35, w₂=0.25, w₃=0.20, w₄=0.20`

## 5. LLM-Annotated Mode

### 5.1 Provider Support

| Provider | API | Models |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Anthropic | Messages API | Claude reasoning models (claude-3-7-sonnet with extended thinking, future reasoning models) |
| Google | Gemini API | Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash |
| OpenAI | Chat Completions API | o1, o3-mini, o3, GPT-4o |

BYOK (Bring Your Own Key): user provides API key via `.diffcore.toml` or environment variable.

**Structured outputs** used for all LLM responses — typed JSON schemas ensure parseable, consistent annotations.

### 5.2 Two-Pass Architecture

**Pass 1: Overview (automatic on request)**
- Input: full diff summary + deterministic flow groups + graph structure
- Output (structured):
  ```json
  {
    "groups": [
      {
        "id": "group_1",
        "name": "User authentication token refresh",
        "summary": "Changes the token refresh flow to use rotating refresh tokens...",
        "review_order_rationale": "Review first — changes auth contract that downstream groups depend on",
        "risk_flags": ["auth_change", "breaking_api"]
      }
    ],
    "overall_summary": "...",
    "suggested_review_order": ["group_1", "group_3", "group_2"]
  }
  ```

**Pass 2: Deep analysis (on-demand, per-group)**
- Input: full file contents + diffs for one group + graph context
- Output (structured):
  ```json
  {
    "group_id": "group_1",
    "flow_narrative": "Data enters at POST /auth/refresh, validated by...",
    "file_annotations": [
      {
        "file": "src/handlers/auth.rs",
        "role_in_flow": "Entrypoint — receives refresh token request",
        "changes_summary": "Added rotation logic...",
        "risks": ["Token invalidation race condition if..."],
        "suggestions": ["Consider adding a mutex on..."]
      }
    ],
    "cross_cutting_concerns": ["Error handling path doesn't cover..."]
  }
  ```

### 5.3 Reasoning Model Usage

Use reasoning/thinking models (Claude extended thinking, o1/o3) for:
- Pass 1: overview requires reasoning about architectural impact
- Pass 2: deep analysis benefits from chain-of-thought on data flow

Standard models as fallback if reasoning models are unavailable or user prefers lower cost.

## 6. Configuration

### 6.1 Auto-Detection (Default)

diffcore infers:
- Language from file extensions + tree-sitter grammar availability
- Framework from import patterns and file structure conventions
- Entrypoints from code patterns
- Architectural layers from directory structure heuristics

### 6.2 Optional Config File: `.diffcore.toml`

```toml
[project]
name = "my-app"

[entrypoints]
# Declare known entrypoints if auto-detection misses them
http = ["src/routes/**/*.ts"]
workers = ["src/jobs/**/*.ts"]
cli = ["src/cli/main.rs"]

[layers]
# Name architectural layers for better grouping
api = "src/handlers/**"
domain = "src/services/**"
persistence = "src/repositories/**"
ui = "src/components/**"

[ignore]
# Files to exclude from analysis
paths = ["**/*.test.ts", "**/*.spec.ts", "migrations/**"]

[llm]
provider = "anthropic"  # "anthropic", "openai", or "gemini"
model = "claude-sonnet-4-6"     # claude-opus-4-6, claude-sonnet-4-6, claude-haiku-4-5
# API key via DIFFCORE_API_KEY env var or:
# key_cmd = "op read op://vault/diffcore/api-key"

[llm.refinement]
# Optional LLM refinement pass — improves grouping/ranking using semantic understanding.
# Deterministic analysis runs first (free, fast), then LLM refines the output.
# Only applied if enabled and API key is available. Falls back to deterministic if LLM fails.
enabled = false
provider = "anthropic"           # can differ from annotation provider
model = "claude-sonnet-4-6"     # user selects the model for refinement
# key_cmd = "op read op://vault/diffcore/refinement-key"
# What the refinement pass can do:
# - split groups that contain logically unrelated changes
# - merge groups that are part of the same logical change
# - re-rank groups based on semantic review ordering ("read schema before handler")
# - reclassify file roles (e.g. "shared utility" → "critical change")
# - re-assign files between groups when static reachability gets it wrong
max_iterations = 1  # max refinement attempts (1 = single call, 2+ = bounded iterative refinement)

[ranking]
# Override default weights
risk = 0.35
centrality = 0.25
surface_area = 0.20
uncertainty = 0.20
```

## 7. CLI Interface

```

**Left panel — Flow Groups:**
- Tree view of semantic groups, ranked by score
- Each group expandable to show files in flow order
- Risk score badge per group
- Click file → opens in center Monaco diff viewer
- "Next file in flow" / "Next group" navigation
- Toggle between deterministic and LLM-annotated mode

**Center panel — Monaco Diff Viewer:**
- Side-by-side or inline diff view
- Full syntax highlighting via Monaco
- Hunk-level navigation
- Inline annotations from LLM (if enabled)

**Right panel — Annotations & Graph:**
- Flow diagram (Mermaid rendered)
- Risk flags and scores
- Per-file role explanation ("this file is the persistence layer for this flow")
- LLM summary and commentary (when annotated)
- "Annotate this group" button for on-demand Pass 2

### Key Interactions
- **Keyboard-driven**: `j/k` for next/prev file, `J/K` for next/prev group, `a` to annotate
- **Flow replay**: `r` to enter/exit replay mode, step through a group's files in data flow order
- **Review workflow**: `x` to toggle flow as reviewed, `c` to add comment (context-sensitive: code selection / file / group), `C` to copy all comments
- **Clipboard**: `y` to copy current file's absolute path, `Y` to copy all paths in current flow
- **Code comments**: select lines in Monaco diff viewer → inline comment button appears → comment anchored to line range with code snippet
- ~~**Risk heatmap**: visual indicator of which groups need most attention~~ (hidden — Phase 9)

## 9. VS Code Extension

### Architecture
- TypeScript extension, minimal logic
- Spawns `diffcore` CLI binary
- Parses JSON output
- Renders in VS Code native UI primitives

### UI Elements
- **Activity Bar icon**: diffcore logo
- **Sidebar tree view**: flow groups → files (same structure as Tauri left panel)
- **Webview panel**: annotations, Mermaid graph, risk scores
- **Commands**:
  - `diffcore.analyze` — run analysis on current branch
  - `diffcore.analyzeRange` — analyze commit range
  - `diffcore.annotate` — trigger LLM annotation
  - `diffcore.nextFile` — next file in current flow
  - `diffcore.nextGroup` — next group
- **Click file** → opens VS Code's native diff editor (not Monaco webview — use the built-in)

See [completed tasks](./tasks/diff-analyzer-completed.md#phase-8-hardening-future).

### Phase 9: UX Polish & Review Workflow

Focused on making the Tauri app a productive daily-driver for code review. Fixes packaging issues, adds review workflow features (comments, tick-off), and improves editor integration.

#### 9.1 Fix app icon packaging
The macOS dock icon shows a generic "exec" label on a dark square instead of the AI-generated diffcore icon (directed-graph with teal/lavender nodes on dark indigo background). The icon was generated correctly (Phase 3) and `cargo tauri icon` produced all platform sizes, but the built app doesn't display it.

- [x] Debug why the generated `.icns` / PNG icons aren't being used in the built app bundle
- [x] Verify `tauri.conf.json` `icon` field points to the correct icon paths
- [x] Rebuild and confirm the dock icon, app switcher (Cmd+Tab), and Finder all show the correct diffcore icon
- [x] Verify on macOS — `.icns` file is correctly embedded in the `.app` bundle's `Contents/Resources/`

#### 9.2 Update LLM model lists
Update the model selector dropdowns in the Tauri settings panel and the config documentation to reflect the latest available models (March 2026).

- [x] **Anthropic:** `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-haiku-4-5`
- [x] **OpenAI:** `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-4.1`, `o4-mini`, `o3`
- [x] **Gemini:** `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, `gemini-3-flash-preview`, `gemini-2.5-flash`
- [x] Update model dropdowns in settings panel (provider → model mapping)
- [x] Update context window sizes for new models in `llm/mod.rs`
- [x] Update default model in `.diffcore.toml` config reference
- [x] Update reasoning model detection for new model IDs (o4-mini, gpt-5.4)

#### 9.3 API key input in frontend
Currently API keys require env vars or `.diffcore.toml` config. Add a text input field in the Tauri settings panel so users can paste their API key directly.

- [x] Add masked text input (password field) in the settings panel under the API key status section
- [x] "Save" button persists the key to `.diffcore.toml` under `[llm] key = "..."` (or provider-specific section)
- [x] Key is masked after entry (show last 4 chars only, e.g. `sk-...abcd`)
- [x] "Clear" button to remove the stored key
- [x] Precedence maintained: `key_cmd` > pasted key in config > env var
- [x] Status indicator updates immediately after saving (green "Configured via config file")
- [x] Tauri IPC command: `save_api_key` — writes key to `.diffcore.toml`, `clear_api_key` — removes it

#### 9.4 Hide risk heatmap
Remove the risk heatmap (squarified treemap) from the right panel UI entirely. The component and code remain in the codebase for future re-enablement, but are not rendered.

- [x] Remove `<RiskHeatmap>` from the right panel render tree (comment out or conditional render with `false`)
- [x] Remove the "Risk heatmap colors render correctly" Playwright test assertion (or skip it)
- [x] Keep `RiskHeatmap.tsx` component and CSS — do not delete, just hide

#### 9.5 Flow tick-off (mark as reviewed)
Add a way to mark flow groups as "reviewed / I'm happy with this" during a review session. Session-only state (not persisted).

- [x] Checkbox or checkmark icon on each flow group in the left panel
- [x] Click to toggle reviewed state — checked groups get a subtle visual treatment (e.g. muted opacity, green checkmark badge, or strikethrough on the group name)
- [x] Reviewed count shown in a summary (e.g. "3/7 flows reviewed" at the top or bottom of left panel)
- [x] Keyboard shortcut: `x` to toggle reviewed state on the currently selected group
- [x] Reviewed state is session-only — resets on page reload or new analysis
- [x] Reviewed groups stay in place (don't move to bottom) — the reviewer might want to revisit

#### 9.6 Right-click file → copy absolute path
Add a context menu on files in the left panel tree view.

- [x] Right-click on any file in the flow group tree → context menu appears
- [x] "Copy File Path" option copies the **absolute** file path to clipboard (e.g. `/Users/james/project/src/services/auth.ts`)
- [x] Use the repo path + relative file path to construct the absolute path
- [x] Toast/notification confirming "Path copied to clipboard"
- [x] Keyboard shortcut: `y` to copy the path of the currently selected file (vim-style yank)

#### 9.7 Open in external editors
Add buttons in the center panel toolbar to open the current file in external editors.

- [x] Toolbar row above the Monaco diff viewer with editor launch buttons
- [x] Supported editors with recognizable icons:
  - **VS Code** — `code` command, VS Code icon
  - **Cursor** — `cursor` command, Cursor icon
  - **Terminal** — open folder in default terminal, terminal icon
- [x] Each button opens the **specific file** currently displayed in the diff viewer
- [x] Uses Tauri `shell:allow-open` or IPC command to spawn the editor process
- [x] IPC command: `open_in_editor(editor: string, file_path: string)` — constructs and executes the appropriate CLI command (`code /path/to/file`, `cursor /path/to/file`, `open -a Terminal /path/to/folder`)
- [x] Graceful fallback if editor is not installed (e.g. `cursor` not found → show tooltip "Cursor not installed")
- [x] Editor icons styled to match Catppuccin theme (small, 20x20px, subtle)

#### 9.8 Copy entire flow (all file paths)
One-click button on each flow group to copy all file paths in that flow.

- [x] "Copy Flow Paths" button (clipboard icon) on each flow group header in the left panel, or as a right-click context menu option on the group
- [x] Copies all file paths in the group as **absolute paths**, one per line, in flow order
- [x] Format: raw paths, no metadata, no group name — ready to paste to an AI agent
  ```
  /Users/james/project/src/routes/auth.ts
  /Users/james/project/src/services/auth-service.ts
  /Users/james/project/src/repositories/user-repo.ts
  ```
- [x] Toast/notification confirming "N file paths copied to clipboard"
- [x] Keyboard shortcut: `Y` (shift+y) to copy all paths in the currently selected group

#### 9.9 Review comments
Add the ability to leave comments on flow groups, individual files, and specific code blocks during review. Three comment scopes: **group-level**, **file-level**, and **code-level** (line range selection). Comments are persisted to the `.diffcore/` folder so they survive app restarts within the same review session.

**Comment creation:**
- [x] `c` keyboard shortcut opens a comment input — context-sensitive:
  - If a **code block is selected** (highlighted lines in Monaco): comment is attached to that line range
  - If a **file** is selected (no code highlight): comment is attached to that file
  - If a **group** is selected (no file): comment is attached to the group
- [x] **Code-level comments (drag to select):** click and drag in the Monaco diff viewer to select/highlight a range of lines → a "Comment" button appears inline (like GitHub PR review) → click to open comment input anchored to that line range
- [x] Inline text input appears:
  - For code-level: below the selected lines in the Monaco editor gutter area
  - For file/group-level: below the selected item in the left panel (or as a small modal)
- [x] Enter to save, Escape to cancel
- [x] Comments shown as small note icons on the file/group in the left panel tree
- [x] Code-level comments shown as gutter annotations in the Monaco diff viewer (colored marker in the gutter + expandable comment bubble)
- [x] Click the note icon or gutter marker to view/edit the comment
- [x] Right-click → "Delete Comment" to remove

**Comment display:**
- [x] Comments visible in the right panel annotations section when the commented file/group is selected
- [x] Code-level comments rendered inline in the Monaco diff viewer with highlighted line range background (subtle accent color) + comment bubble below the selection
- [x] Comment count badge on groups that have comments (on the group itself or its files)
- [x] Visual: Catppuccin-styled comment bubbles with subtle accent border

**Copy all comments:**
- [x] "Copy All Comments" button in the left panel header (or bottom toolbar)
- [x] Copies all comments as a formatted list with absolute file paths
- [x] **Code-level comments include the selected code snippet** in the export:
  ```
  /Users/james/project/src/routes/auth.ts:42-58
  ```typescript
  async function validateEmail(email: string) {
    // TODO: add proper validation
    return email.includes('@');
  }
  ```
  > Missing input validation on the email field — this should use a proper email regex

  /Users/james/project/src/services/auth-service.ts
  > Should we add rate limiting here?

  Flow: "Auth & Session Management"
  > Overall looks good but needs error handling review
  ```
- [x] Format designed for pasting to an AI agent as review feedback — includes the actual code being commented on so the agent has full context
- [x] Keyboard shortcut: `C` (shift+c) to copy all comments

**Persistence:**
- [x] Comments stored as JSON in `.diffcore/comments.json` (alongside cache and other diffcore state)
- [x] Keyed by analysis hash (so comments are scoped to a specific diff/analysis run)
- [x] Format:
  ```json
  {
    "analysis_hash": "abc123",
    "comments": [
      {
        "type": "code",
        "group_id": "group_1",
        "file_path": "src/auth.ts",
        "start_line": 42,
        "end_line": 58,
        "selected_code": "async function validateEmail(email: string) {\n  // TODO: add proper validation\n  return email.includes('@');\n}",
        "text": "Missing input validation — should use a proper email regex",
        "created_at": "2026-03-20T14:30:00Z"
      },
      {
        "type": "file",
        "group_id": "group_1",
        "file_path": "src/auth.ts",
        "start_line": null,
        "end_line": null,
        "selected_code": null,
        "text": "Missing validation",
        "created_at": "2026-03-20T14:30:00Z"
      },
      {
        "type": "group",
        "group_id": "group_1",
        "file_path": null,
        "start_line": null,
        "end_line": null,
        "selected_code": null,
        "text": "Needs error handling review",
        "created_at": "2026-03-20T14:31:00Z"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- [x] Loaded on app start if analysis hash matches
- [x] Tauri IPC commands: `save_comment`, `delete_comment`, `load_comments`, `export_comments`

#### 9.10 Flowchart node click → collapse graph + open file
When a user clicks a node in the React Flow graph, it should collapse the graph section within the right panel and open that file in the diff viewer. This creates a smooth "explore graph → dive into file" workflow.

- [x] Click a React Flow node → file opens in the center panel Monaco diff viewer (existing behavior)
- [x] Additionally: the React Flow graph section in the right panel **collapses** (animates to a thin bar or accordion header showing "Flow Graph ▶")
- [x] The right panel reclaims the space — annotations/details section expands to fill
- [x] Click the collapsed graph header to re-expand it
- [x] Graph collapse state resets when switching to a different group

### Phase 10: UX Fixes & Bug Fixes

Focused on fixing usability issues, keyboard shortcut conflicts, and UI bugs discovered during daily use.

#### 10.1 Flow graph: navigate on node click without closing
When clicking a node in the React Flow graph, navigate to that file in the diff viewer but do NOT close/collapse the graph. The current Phase 9.10 behavior (collapse on click) is too aggressive — users want to explore the graph and jump between nodes without losing the visual context.

- [x] Remove the auto-collapse behavior when clicking a React Flow node
- [x] Keep the navigation behavior: clicking a node still selects the file and updates the diff viewer
- [x] Graph stays open and visible after node click — user can click multiple nodes to explore
- [x] Manual collapse still works via the accordion header toggle

#### 10.2 Fix c/C keyboard shortcuts — Monaco read-only conflict
Pressing `c` or `C` currently shows "Cannot edit in read-only editor" because the keypress reaches Monaco before the app's keyboard handler intercepts it.

- [x] Intercept `c` and `C` keypresses at the app level before they reach Monaco
- [x] `c` opens comment input (context-sensitive: code selection → code comment, file → file comment, group → group comment) — already specified in 9.9 but not working due to Monaco capture
- [x] `C` copies all comments — already specified in 9.9 but not working due to Monaco capture
- [x] Verify no other single-key shortcuts are being swallowed by Monaco's read-only editor

#### 10.3 Make "Copy All Comments" more visible
The "Copy All Comments" button is hard to discover in the current UI.

- [x] Move or duplicate the button to a more prominent location (e.g. sticky footer bar in the left panel, or a toolbar button with clear label)
- [x] Add a visual badge showing comment count (e.g. "Copy All Comments (5)")
- [x] Consider a floating action button or persistent toolbar element that's always visible when comments exist
- [x] Keyboard hint tooltip showing `C` shortcut on hover

#### 10.4 Fix group/reviewed count after LLM refinement
Bug: After LLM refinement changes the number of groups, the UI shows stale counts like "4/3 reviewed" where the denominator doesn't match the actual group count.

- [x] When refinement completes and group structure changes, reset the reviewed state
- [x] Update the total group count in the "N/M reviewed" display to reflect the new group count
- [x] Clear per-group reviewed checkmarks since the groups have been reorganized
- [x] Show a brief toast: "Groups updated by refinement — review state reset"

#### 10.5 Auto-center/fit-all when opening flow graph
When the flow graph component opens, it should automatically zoom and pan to show all nodes.

- [x] Call `fitView()` (React Flow API) when the graph section is expanded or when switching to a new group
- [x] Add appropriate padding so nodes aren't flush against edges
- [x] Animate the fit-view transition for a smooth experience
- [x] Respect any user zoom/pan after initial fit — don't re-fit on every render

#### 10.6 Consolidate "Open With" into single dropdown
Replace the separate editor buttons in the diff viewer toolbar with a single "Open With" dropdown.

- [x] Single "Open With" dropdown button in the toolbar with a dropdown arrow
- [x] Dropdown lists available editors: VS Code, Cursor, Zed, Vim, Terminal
- [x] Each option has an icon and label
- [x] **Actually opens the file** — use Tauri `shell.open` or `Command` API to execute: `code <path>`, `cursor <path>`, `zed <path>`, `vim <path>` (in terminal), `open -a Terminal <folder>`
- [x] Remove the "Would open..." placeholder behavior — execute the real command
- [x] Detect which editors are installed (check if command exists) and only show installed ones
- [x] Remember last-used editor choice in session

#### 10.7 Adversarial edge cases: circular refs & import graph semantics
Create adversarial test fixtures to stress-test the clustering algorithm with degenerate dependency patterns. Use LLM-based evaluation to verify improvements.

- [x] **Circular imports**: A→B→C→A cycles — verify no infinite loops, groups are still meaningful
- [x] **Diamond dependencies**: A→B, A→C, B→D, C→D — verify D is assigned to the correct group
- [x] **Barrel file explosion**: `index.ts` re-exporting 50+ modules — verify barrel files don't distort grouping
- [x] **Re-export chains**: A re-exports B which re-exports C — verify edge resolution traces through
- [x] **Self-referencing modules**: File imports from itself (aliased paths) — verify no crash
- [x] **Deeply nested transitive deps**: 10+ levels of transitive imports — verify depth limiting works
- [x] **Hub-and-spoke**: One file imported by 30+ others — verify it doesn't pull everything into one group
- [x] **Orphan clusters**: Groups of files connected to each other but not to any entrypoint — verify they form their own infrastructure group, not silently dropped
- [x] **Cross-language imports**: Python calling a compiled Rust module, TS importing WASM — verify graceful handling
- [x] Create test fixtures for each case with expected grouping output
- [x] Run LLM refinement on each case and score with eval suite — compare deterministic vs refined groupings
- [x] Add adversarial fixtures to the regression test suite

### Phase 11: Multi-Language Support

Expand tree-sitter language support beyond TypeScript/JavaScript and Python. The architecture supports this declaratively — adding a language requires writing `.scm` query files for `imports`, `exports`, `definitions`, `calls`, and `assignments` under `crates/diffcore-core/queries/{lang}/`, plus updating the `Language` enum in `ast.rs` and adding the tree-sitter grammar dependency.

## 12. Incremental Parse Caching (Performance) — **NEXT PRIORITY**

Tree-sitter parsing is the main bottleneck in the analysis pipeline. Each file is parsed **twice** (once for imports/definitions/calls in `parse_with_queries()`, once for assignments/arguments in `extract_data_flow()`), and no results are cached between runs. With 1500+ tests and growing, this adds up fast.

Goal: cache deterministic intermediate results so repeated/unchanged inputs skip expensive work.

### 12.1 Deduplicate per-file double parse

**Problem:** `parse_with_queries()` and `extract_data_flow()` both call `parse_tree()` independently, creating two `Parser` instances and two full tree-sitter parses for the same source.

- [x] Refactor `parse_to_ir()` in `pipeline.rs` to call `parse_tree()` once and pass the resulting `tree_sitter::Tree` to both `parse_with_queries()` and `extract_data_flow()`
- [x] Update method signatures to accept an optional pre-parsed tree
- [x] Benchmark: measured ~1.2-1.3x speedup (TS: 947→777µs, Py: 659→509µs) — parse is only part of per-file cost; query execution dominates

### 12.2 Content-addressed IrFile cache

**Problem:** Re-running analysis on the same file content re-parses and re-extracts everything from scratch.

- [x] Add `sha2` content hash of source → `IrFile` cache (in-memory `DashMap<[u8; 32], IrFile>`) — `IrCache` type in `pipeline.rs`
- [x] Key: `SHA-256(file_path + "\0" + source_content)` — content-addressed, so identical content = cache hit regardless of branch/ref
- [x] Integrate into `parse_to_ir()` and `parse_all_to_ir()`: check cache before parsing via `Option<&IrCache>` parameter
- [x] Thread the cache through all callers (cross_layer_audit, benchmarks, unit tests) — pass `None` when not needed, `Some(&cache)` when sharing
- [x] For tests: `IrCache` uses `DashMap` (thread-safe, lock-free reads) — shareable across rayon parallel parsing
- [x] For CLI: populate cache per invocation (single-run benefit from dedup; cross-run benefit requires disk cache in 12.4)
- [x] 12 new unit tests: cache hit/miss, different content/path, partial hit, cross-batch sharing, byte-identical verification, Send+Sync

### 12.3 Lazy QueryEngine initialization per language

**Problem:** `QueryEngine::new()` compiles `.scm` queries for all 12+ languages upfront, even if the diff only contains TypeScript files.

- [x] Change query compilation from eager (all languages in constructor) to lazy (compile on first use per language)
- [x] Use `OnceCell<CompiledQuery>` or equivalent for each language's query set — `once_cell::sync::OnceCell<LanguageQueries>` with `get_or_try_init()` in `get_lang_queries()`
- [x] Benchmark: measure `QueryEngine::new()` time before/after — `new()` is now ~348 ns (near-instant), first parse compiles only the needed language (TS: ~13.4 ms, Python: ~5.3 ms), subsequent parses: ~569 µs

### 12.4 Disk-persistent IrFile cache (optional, for CLI)

**Problem:** CLI invocations don't share state. Re-running `diffcore analyze` on the same branch re-parses all files.

- [x] Serialize `IrFile` cache to `.diffcore/cache/ir/{content_hash}.bincode` — `DiskIrCache` in `pipeline.rs` using `bincode` v1 serialization
- [x] On startup, load existing cache entries; on shutdown, write new entries — `DiskIrCache::load()` reads `.bincode` files into `IrCache`; `DiskIrCache::flush()` writes new entries
- [x] Add cache size limit (e.g. 100MB) with LRU eviction — `evict_lru()` sorts by mtime, removes oldest files until under limit
- [x] Add `--no-cache` flag to bypass — `AnalyzeArgs::no_cache` in CLI, skips `DiskIrCache::load()` when set
- [x] Invalidation: content-addressed, so no explicit invalidation needed — stale entries just get evicted by LRU
- [x] 11 new tests: load empty, flush creates files, roundtrip, byte-identical roundtrip, no-cache flag, LRU eviction, malformed files, non-bincode files, idempotent flush, multi-run accumulation, readonly dir

### 12.5 Test harness optimizations

**Problem:** E2E tests create fresh `QueryEngine` instances per test and re-parse identical fixture files.

- [x] Create `OnceLock<QueryEngine>` shared across test binaries — file-level `shared_test_engine()` in `query_engine.rs`, module-level `shared_engine()` in `pipeline.rs` tests, `shared_engine()` in `tests/helpers/mod.rs`, `OnceLock` in `eval/fixtures.rs` and `cross_layer_audit.rs`
- [x] Share the IrFile cache via `OnceLock<IrCache>` — `shared_cache()` in `pipeline.rs` tests and `tests/helpers/mod.rs` (content-addressed, no cross-test pollution)
- [x] Measure: **4x wall-clock speedup** (30.4s → 7.6s), **19x user time reduction** (259.5s → 13.7s) for `cargo test --package diffcore-core`

### 12.6 Test profile optimization

**Problem:** Tests compile and run with default `[profile.dev]` settings — no optimizations at all.

- [x] Add `[profile.test] opt-level = 1` to root `Cargo.toml` — trades slightly longer compile for 10-30% faster runtime
- [x] Document recommended test invocation: `cargo test -- --test-threads=$(nproc)` (tests are isolated via TempDirs, safe to parallelize)

### 12.7 Reuse Parser instances per language

**Problem:** `parse_tree()` in `query_engine.rs` creates a new `tree_sitter::Parser` on every call. Across the test suite this means thousands of unnecessary allocations.

- [x] Store a `Parser` per language using `thread_local!` with `RefCell<HashMap<Language, Parser>>` — each rayon thread gets its own set of parsers, avoiding contention
- [x] Reuse across all `parse_tree()` calls for the same language — `parse_tree()` now takes a `Language` key, looks up the thread-local parser, creates one on first use
- [x] Verify thread safety: `Parser` is `Send` but `!Sync`, so cannot be stored in `QueryEngine` (shared via `&` across rayon threads); thread-local storage gives each worker its own parsers with zero synchronization overhead. 6 new tests: same-language reuse, multi-language reuse, rayon parallel, parse_tree_for_path reuse, extract_data_flow reuse, fresh-vs-reused result identity

### 12.8 Parallelize graph building

**Problem:** `SymbolGraph::build()` and `build_from_ir()` in `graph.rs` run sequentially — Phase 1 (add nodes) and Phase 2 (add edges) iterate files one at a time with no parallelism.

- [x] Phase 1: use rayon to collect node data per file in parallel, then merge into graph single-threaded
- [x] Phase 2: use rayon to compute edges per file in parallel, then add to graph single-threaded
- [x] Benchmark: 1.3x at 50 files, 1.8x at 100 files (rayon overhead dominates at small synthetic IR scale; real codebases with heavier parse results will see larger gains)

### 12.9 Efficient flow pattern matching

**Problem:** Heuristic flow analysis in `flow.rs` matches call sites against 100+ pattern strings (DB_WRITE_METHODS, EVENT_EMIT_METHODS, etc.) using `.contains()` per pattern per call — O(patterns × calls) substring searches.

- [x] Replace linear `.contains()` scans with Aho-Corasick automaton for substring matching (SQL keywords, DB keywords, ORM names) and `HashSet` for exact/suffix matching (log patterns, method suffixes, non-DB receivers)
- [x] Add `aho-corasick` crate dependency
- [x] Build automatons and hash sets once via `OnceLock`, reuse across all files. Also eliminated `format!()` allocations in framework detection and HTTP/config pattern matching
- [x] Benchmark added: flow_analysis/heuristic_patterns at 20/50/100 files with 37 mixed call sites per file (criterion)

### 12.10 Verification

- [x] All existing tests still pass (1638 tests: 1426 unit + 212 integration)
- [x] Add a benchmark test (criterion) for: graph_build_from_ir (20/50/100 files, parallel vs serial) and flow_analysis/heuristic_patterns (20/50/100 files with 37 mixed call sites each)
- [x] Cache hit/miss logging behind `DIFFCORE_CACHE_DEBUG=1` env var (per-operation HIT/MISS lines + summary stats to stderr)
- [x] No behavior change: cached results are byte-identical to uncached results (verified by `ir_cache_cached_result_byte_identical` test)

## 13. Testing Plan

### 13.1 Test Convention

**Rust convention — structural separation, not file suffixes:**

- **Unit tests** — co-located in the source file via `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { }` at the bottom. Tests internal/private functions. Fast, no I/O.
- **Integration tests** — separate `tests/` directory at the crate root. Each file compiles as its own binary and can only access the crate's public API. Tests cross-module behavior.
- **Slow/live tests** — gated with `#[ignore]`, run via `cargo test -- --ignored`. Includes live LLM calls, large fixture repos, performance benchmarks.

**Frontend convention:**

- **Unit tests** — co-located as `Component.test.tsx` next to `Component.tsx` (Vitest + React Testing Library). Tests component logic, state, props.
- **Integration tests** — `tests/integration/` at the Tauri UI root. Tests IPC bridge, store ↔ component wiring.
- **E2E tests** — `tests/e2e/` using Playwright. Tests real rendered output in a browser context. **Prefer integration/E2E tests over unit tests when code touches renderers** (Monaco, Mermaid, Tauri webview) — mocked renderers give false confidence.

**Fixture repo builder:** A test helper that programmatically creates git repos with known structure, commits changes, and produces diffs with predictable flow groupings. This is critical — it makes tests deterministic and self-contained.

These tests create real git repos, make real commits, and run the full pipeline.

| Test | Setup | Verification |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `test_e2e_simple_express_app` | Create 5-file Express app, add a new route with handler→service→repo | Produces 1 flow group with files in correct order: route→service→repo |
| `test_e2e_nextjs_page_change` | Create Next.js app, add API route + page + Prisma model change | Produces >= 2 groups (API flow and UI flow), correctly separated |
| `test_e2e_python_fastapi` | Create FastAPI app, add endpoint + schema + repository | Correct entrypoint detection, DB write heuristic fires |

### 13.6 Snapshot Tests — ✅ All 8 implemented

Use `insta` crate for snapshot testing of JSON output. Implemented in `tests/snapshot_tests.rs` with 8 fixture scenarios. Snapshots stored in `tests/snapshots/`. Git SHAs are redacted for determinism.

For each fixture repo:
1. Run `diffcore analyze` via `run_pipeline()`
2. Compare JSON output against stored snapshot
3. If graph construction or ranking algorithm changes, review and approve new snapshots with `cargo insta review`

| Test | Fixture | What it snapshots |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `snapshot_simple_express_app` | 5-file Express app (route→service→repo) | 2 flow groups, edges, flow ordering |
| `snapshot_python_fastapi` | FastAPI endpoint + service + repo + schema | Python entrypoint detection, data flow |
| `snapshot_cross_cutting_refactor` | Rename shared utility used by 5 files | 6 files in infrastructure (no entrypoints) |
| `snapshot_multi_entrypoint` | HTTP route + queue worker with shared service | Multi-entrypoint grouping, shared file assignment |
| `snapshot_mixed_language` | TypeScript + Python in same repo | Multi-language detection and grouping |
| `snapshot_infrastructure_heavy` | Docker, CI, env, scripts, docs, migrations | Infrastructure sub-group classification |
| `snapshot_go_http_api` | Go HTTP handler → service → repository | Go language support, net/http detection |
| `snapshot_empty_diff` | No changes between base and head | Graceful empty result |

### 13.7 Property-Based Tests

Use `proptest` crate for fuzzing graph construction and ranking.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Every changed file appears in exactly one group | No file lost, no file duplicated |
| Group file order is topologically valid | BFS-tree ordering: flow_position monotonically non-decreasing, and for edges where source has strictly smaller flow_position than target, source appears first. Implemented as `prop_group_file_order_topologically_valid` in `cluster.rs` |
| Ranking scores are in [0.0, 1.0] | No score exceeds bounds |
| Ranking is total order | No two groups have identical rank (tie-break is deterministic) |
| Empty diff → empty groups | No phantom groups from empty input |
| Single file diff → single group | Minimal case always works |
| Graph with no edges → all infrastructure | Disconnected files go to infrastructure group |
| Determinism | `analyze(X) == analyze(X)` for any input (run 10 times) |

### 13.8 Performance Benchmarks

Use `criterion` crate for benchmarking critical paths.

| Benchmark | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| `bench_parse_100_ts_files` | < 2s |
| `bench_graph_construction_100_files` | < 500ms |
| `bench_clustering_100_nodes` | < 100ms |
| `bench_ranking_20_groups` | < 10ms |
| `bench_full_pipeline_50_files` | < 5s total |
| `bench_full_pipeline_100_files` | < 15s total |
| `bench_json_serialization` | < 50ms for 100-file output |

Benchmarks run in CI to catch performance regressions.

### 13.10 Tauri App — Playwright E2E Tests

**Testing philosophy:** Prefer integration tests over unit tests when code touches renderers (Monaco, Mermaid, Tauri webview). Unit tests with mocked renderers give false confidence — Playwright tests hit the real rendered output in a real browser context.

**Setup:** Playwright tests launch the Tauri app via `tauri-driver` (WebDriver protocol) or directly against the dev server with mocked IPC. Test fixtures use pre-computed analysis JSON from the synthetic eval codebases (Phase 7).

**Full workflow E2E tests:**

| Test | What it verifies |
|------|-----------------|
| `e2e/analyze-flow.spec.ts` | Open app → load analysis → flow groups appear in left panel → click group → files expand → click file → diff renders in Monaco → annotations show in right panel |
| `e2e/keyboard-navigation.spec.ts` | Load analysis → press `j` → next file selected + diff updates → press `J` → next group selected → press `k` → previous file → press `K` → previous group → verify focus + scroll position at each step |
| `e2e/annotate-flow.spec.ts` | Load analysis → click "Annotate" on a group → loading spinner appears → LLM annotations render in right panel → risk badges update → Mermaid graph updates |
| `e2e/multi-group-review.spec.ts` | Load 50-file analysis → verify all groups render → navigate through every group sequentially → verify no stale state between groups → verify Monaco doesn't leak instances |

**Panel layout integration tests:**

| Test | What it verifies |
|------|-----------------|
| `e2e/layout.spec.ts` | Three panels visible on load with correct proportions (measure widths) |
| `e2e/layout.spec.ts` | Drag resize handle → panels resize → Monaco reflows (no overflow) |
| `e2e/layout.spec.ts` | Collapse left panel → center + right expand → expand again → original widths restored |
| `e2e/layout.spec.ts` | Window resize → panels reflow proportionally → no horizontal scroll |

**Error state E2E tests:**

| Test | What it verifies |
|------|-----------------|
| `e2e/error-states.spec.ts` | Invalid repo path → user-friendly error message in UI (not blank screen) |
| `e2e/error-states.spec.ts` | Empty diff → "No changes found" message with helpful guidance |
| `e2e/error-states.spec.ts` | LLM annotation failure → error toast, app still functional |
| `e2e/error-states.spec.ts` | Corrupted analysis JSON → error boundary catches, recovery option shown |

### 13.13 Regression Test Suite — ✅ All 13 implemented

Implemented as integration tests in `tests/regressions.rs` using RepoBuilder to programmatically recreate each scenario. Each test creates a real git repo, commits the problematic state, runs the full pipeline, and asserts correctness.

| Scenario | Tests | What it verifies |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| 001 — Barrel file explosion | `regression_001_barrel_file_50_reexports_no_explosion`, `regression_001_barrel_single_module_change` | 50-module barrel doesn't explode group count; single module change doesn't pull siblings |
| 002 — Circular dependency | `regression_002_circular_dependency_no_infinite_loop`, `regression_002_circular_with_entrypoint` | A→B→C→A cycle terminates; cycle with route entrypoint produces valid groups |
| 003 — Dynamic import | `regression_003_dynamic_import_no_crash`, `regression_003_dynamic_require_template_literal` | `import()` and `require()` with template literals don't crash parser |
| 004 — Monorepo cross-package | `regression_004_monorepo_cross_package_imports`, `regression_004_monorepo_shared_dep_not_lost` | Cross-package `@scope/pkg` imports don't crash; shared dep files not lost |
| 005 — File rename chain | `regression_005_file_rename_chain`, `regression_005_rename_with_content_change` | Rename chain doesn't double-count; rename + modify in same commit works |
| 006 — Generated code | `regression_006_generated_code_not_dominating` | Large `__generated__/` files don't swamp flow groups; real routes still detected |
| 007 — Mixed language | `regression_007_mixed_language_ts_python_rust`, `regression_007_mixed_language_no_cross_contamination` | TS + Python + Rust in same diff; isolated language files don't cross-contaminate groups |

## 14. Desktop Review UX and Restorable State (Normative)

This section defines how the desktop app MUST behave. It is a product behavior contract, not a task checklist.

### 14.1 Implemented Baseline (As of 2026-04-19)

The desktop app currently provides the following baseline behavior:

- Replay mode supports hunk-level navigation across files in flow order, marks visited hunks, and supports comment-on-current-hunk using the existing code-comment mechanism.
- Flow graph edges and the edges list are clickable and navigate to the corresponding file/symbol location in the diff viewer.
- The diff editor supports editing in compare modes that explicitly allow edits; branch/commit comparisons run without uncommitted worktree inclusion.
- Tool-generated edit comments are debounced and update per edited hunk; reverting edited hunks removes corresponding auto comments.
- Branch/commit comparison and explicit uncommitted comparison targets (staged/unstaged) are both represented in the UI.

### 14.2 Cross-File Search Contract

The desktop app MUST provide an app-level cross-file search workflow with the following requirements:

- `F` opens the app cross-file search UI (regardless of panel focus, including Monaco), subject to the keyboard focus policy in Section 14.7.
- `f` triggers in-file Monaco find/search for the currently visible editor content.
- Search operates across the active analysis corpus and returns file + line matches with jump-to-location behavior.
- A checkbox labeled `show unchanged files` MUST exist, defaulting to `false`.
- When `show unchanged files` is `false`, search results and file-scoped navigation surfaces MUST prioritize changed files only.
- When `show unchanged files` is `true`, search and relevant navigation surfaces MUST include unchanged files as first-class results.
- The checkbox state MUST influence the `F` cross-file search workflow and any other file-visibility/filtering flows that share the same corpus selection semantics.

### 14.3 Repository Selection and Startup Contract

The desktop app MUST support repository selection and startup behavior as follows:

- If the app is launched with a directory argument, that directory MUST be opened as the initial repository path.
- The top bar MUST provide a `Browse` button that opens a native folder picker.
- Selecting a folder via `Browse` MUST populate the repository input and load repository metadata as if it were typed manually.

### 14.4 Full Application State Persistence and Restore Contract

The desktop app MUST persist and restore complete application state, not only isolated artifacts.

- A durable state snapshot MUST include at minimum: repository path, compare targets, view filters (including `show unchanged files`), selected group/file, open tabs, replay state, comments, activity timeline/events, analysis outputs, LLM summaries/annotations, and persisted logs.
- The storage model MUST include a log folder concept under the config hierarchy, defaulting to `$CONFIG/logs/`.
- State snapshots and logs MUST be versioned and timestamped so they can be reopened safely across app restarts.
- The UI MUST provide a trivial restore path (for example: `Restore Last Session` and/or `Restore Snapshot...`) without requiring manual filesystem edits.
- Restore MUST be best-effort and fault-tolerant: invalid or partial snapshot data must not crash the app and must surface a user-visible recovery message.

### 14.5 Separation of Concerns

To avoid regressions, the following boundaries are mandatory:

- Replay hunk navigation MUST derive from editor-visible review hunks, not the comments subsystem.
- Auto-generated edit comments MUST derive from user edits relative to baseline content and MUST NOT drive replay-hunk navigation state.
- Scroll orchestration may share a common mechanism, but hunk-source semantics and comment-source semantics MUST remain independent.

### 14.5.5 Hunk Navigation Visibility

- Hunk navigation must be available and visible even outside of replay mode.
- In fact, ALL OTHER replay mode navigation buttons must be visible (even if disabled) at all times, to provide users with a consistent mental model of the available navigation actions.
- Hunk navigation buttons must be disabled when there are no review hunks in the current file, but they must not be hidden.
- Hunk navigation buttons must be enabled when there are review hunks in the current file, regardless of whether the user is currently in replay mode or not.

### 14.6 Editing Controls and Save Semantics

The desktop app MUST expose explicit editing controls in the top bar:

- `Allow editing files` toggle.
- `Auto save` toggle.
- `Save` button for manual persistence when auto-save is disabled.

Control behavior requirements:

- `Allow editing files` MUST be disabled and unchecked outside supported compare target pairings.
- When editing is disabled, the Monaco modified pane MUST be read-only.
- When `Auto save` is enabled, edit persistence MUST continue to use debounced save behavior.
- When `Auto save` is disabled, edits MUST remain local until `Save` is pressed.

### 14.7 Keyboard and Focus Policy

Keyboard behavior MUST be focus-aware:

- While Monaco is actively editing (focused and editing enabled), app-level navigation keybinds MUST be suppressed.
- When Monaco is unfocused, or editing is disabled, app-level keybinds MUST be active.
- App-level navigation MUST support both vim-style keys and arrow keys for equivalent movement actions.
- Monaco default editor keybinds (for example F12 and multi-cursor/editing shortcuts) MUST always remain available, except when they directly conflict with app-level navigation in which case the above focus policy applies.
- Focus state MUST be visually indicated to the user (for example, Monaco border highlight when focused).
- Monaco editor keybinds must continue to work even when the editor is in read-only mode (editing disabled), except for those that conflict with app-level navigation. E.g. F12 must coninue to work for "Go to Definition" even when editing is disabled.

### 14.8 Source Tab Changed-State Visibility

The Subsystem Source tab MUST expose changed-state affordances:

- Changed items MUST be visually highlighted.
- A `show unchanged` toggle MUST exist in the Source tab, defaulting to `true`.
- When `show unchanged` is disabled in Source tab context, unchanged items MUST be hidden from that tab's list/tree views.

### 14.9 Persisted Review Progress

Flow review progress MUST persist across sessions and re-analysis:

- Reviewed flow-group state MUST be stored in restorable app state.
- Re-running analysis MUST restore prior reviewed progress where groups can be matched deterministically.
- When the group structure changes, progress reconciliation MUST be best-effort and transparent to the user.

### 14.10 Graph Granularity Setting (Stub)

Graph view configuration MUST include a granularity selector that supports future symbol-level graph rendering:

- Add a graph granularity setting that includes at least `file` and a stub option for `module/class/method`.
- For now, non-file granularity may be marked as preview/stub, but the UI contract and persisted setting must exist.

### 14.11 Info Tab Reanalysis Controls

The Info view MUST support per-provider model control and guided regeneration:

- A model dropdown for the currently selected provider MUST be available directly in Info view.
- A `Regenerate with feedback/question` action MUST open a dialog that:
  - captures user feedback/question text,
  - asks whether to include previous output as context.
- Added user feedback/comments MUST always be included in reanalysis context.
- Inclusion of previous output MUST follow the explicit user choice from the dialog.

### 14.12 Theming Consistency

All select/dropdown controls in these workflows MUST match the app theme:

- Provider/model dropdowns in Info and settings-related flows MUST use the same themed styling as the rest of the UI.
- New controls introduced by this section MUST not fall back to unthemed browser-default select styling.

### 14.13 Left Pane File Metadata Presentation

The left pane file rows MUST expose compact metadata optimized for scan speed:

- Each file row MUST show git short status, file classification, file extension, filename, abbreviated folder, and line deltas.
- Canonical visual layout example: `M H RS example-file: s/m/rust +12 -3`.
- Literal wrapper punctuation such as `[` and `]` MUST NOT be required for status/extension tokens.
- Directory prefix compaction SHOULD abbreviate leading directories for dense scanning while preserving enough path context to disambiguate sibling files.
- Distinct semantic styling is required:
  - status token (`M`, `A`, `D`, etc.) uses highlight foreground/background,
  - directory prefix uses muted gray tone,
  - base filename uses primary foreground,
  - extension tag uses secondary highlight foreground/background.

### 14.13.5 Unstaged-to-Staged Status Coverage

In the `unstaged -> staged` comparison mode, file status coverage MUST include additions and deletions in addition to modifications:

- Modified files MUST surface as `M`.
- Added files MUST surface as `A`.
- Deleted files MUST surface as `D`.
- The mode MUST not silently collapse all statuses to `M`.

### 14.14 Project Navigation Quick-Pick (Recents + Favorites)

Repository navigation MUST include quick project switching:

- The top bar MUST provide a quick-pick interaction for recent repositories.
- Users MUST be able to pin/unpin favorite repositories.
- Favorites MUST be visibly distinct from non-favorites in quick-pick lists.
- Recent/favorite repository lists MUST persist across sessions.

### 14.15 Search Result Contrast

Cross-file search result rows MUST remain legible under the active theme:

- Search result text color MUST meet contrast expectations on result-row backgrounds.
- Button-based or interactive result rows MUST not inherit default browser text colors that become illegible in dark themes.

### 14.16 Hunk Navigation Reliability Across File Boundaries

Hunk navigation MUST remain deterministic when moving between files:

- Transitioning from the last hunk of one file to the first hunk of the next file MUST not exhibit race-driven target drift.
- Pending cross-file hunk targets MUST be resolved only against the intended file's ready hunks.
- If hunks are not immediately available after file switch, navigation MUST retry in a bounded, fail-safe manner rather than silently landing on incorrect hunks.
- Hunk navigation MUST be aware of diff rendering mode (`inline` vs `side-by-side`) and navigate to the correct visible location in either mode.
- Removal-only hunks MUST account for line-offset semantics so navigation does not progressively drift as offsets accumulate.
- When the user navigates across file boundaries (e.g., next hunk from the final hunk in a file), the target MUST be the first hunk in the next file (or last hunk when moving backward).
- `diff hunks` and `user edit hunks` are distinct concepts and MUST NOT be conflated.
- APIs/methods that expose review/navigation hunks MUST use diff-hunk semantics.
- APIs/methods that expose user-entered local edits MUST use user-edit semantics (for example naming akin to `getUserEdits`), and must not be used as the source of replay navigation.

## 15. Refinement Robustness Program (Planned)

This section defines a six-step hardening plan for the LLM refinement path, focused on structured-output reliability, semantic safety, and graceful fallback behavior.

### 15.1 Step 1: Document Runtime Flow and Failure Surface (Executed)

The canonical refinement runtime flow is now defined here and is the source of truth for failure handling:

1. UI trigger:
  - Tauri app invokes refinement from `runRefinement` and receives either job success payload or `CommandError::Llm` failure text.
2. Command dispatch:
  - `start_refine_groups` builds provider/model config and schedules the async job.
3. Request construction:
  - `run_refinement_with_activity` serializes analysis and calls `build_refinement_request`.
4. Provider call:
  - `provider.refine_groups(&request)` executes against the selected LLM backend.
5. Parse stage:
  - Provider parser converts raw model output into `RefinementResponse`.
  - Known failure class recorded: prose-prefixed output before JSON can fail at top-level parse (for example `expected value at line 1 column 1`).
6. Semantic apply stage:
  - No-op response: keep deterministic groups.
  - Non-empty response: `apply_refinement_lenient` performs repair-then-drop semantics and emits warnings.
7. User-visible result:
  - Success path returns `RefinementResult` (with warnings when relevant).
  - Failure path maps to `CommandError::Llm`, surfaced in UI job/error messaging.

Rule for future changes:
- Every refinement change MUST identify which runtime stage above it modifies (trigger, request, provider, parse, semantic apply, or surfacing).

Touchpoints to focus efforts:
- `crates/diffcore-tauri/ui/src/App.tsx` (`runRefinement`, error display path)
- `crates/diffcore-tauri/src/commands/llm.rs` (`start_refine_groups`, `run_refinement_with_activity`, `refine_groups`)
- `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/mod.rs` (`refinement_system_prompt`, `refinement_user_prompt`)
- `crates/diffcore-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` (`CommandError::Llm` wrapping)

Acceptance intent:
- Engineers can point to this section and identify exactly where parse, validation, apply, and UI surfacing failures are handled.

### 15.2 Step 2: Tighten the Refinement I/O Contract (Executed)

The refinement I/O contract is now explicit and testable.

Request payload contract (`RefinementRequest`):
- `diff_summary`: human summary of diff scope.
- `groups`: canonical flow groups with stable `id`, `name`, and `files` membership.
- `infrastructure_files`: changed files not assigned to any flow group.
- `analysis_json`: full deterministic analysis snapshot.
- Valid ID allow-list is derived from `groups[*].id` plus literal `infrastructure`; prompt text requires literal IDs for all ID-bearing fields.

Response contract (`RefinementResponse`):
- Operations: `splits`, `merges`, `re_ranks`, `reclassifications`, plus `reasoning`.
- ID-bearing fields (`source_group_id`, `group_ids`, `group_id`, `from_group_id`, `to_group_id`) MUST use literal group IDs or `infrastructure` where allowed.
- Display names MUST NOT be used in ID positions.
- Semantic references are validated against source groups/files before strict apply; lenient apply repairs known ID/name substitutions and drops invalid residual ops.

Normative response examples are now part of the schema description:
- Valid no-op response (all operation arrays empty).
- Valid minimal non-empty response (single `re_rank`).

Touchpoints to focus efforts:
- `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/schema.rs` (`RefinementRequest`, `RefinementResponse`, `refinement_schema_description`)
- `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/refinement.rs` (`build_refinement_request`)
- `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/mod.rs` (`refinement_user_prompt` ID allow-list and prompt framing)

Acceptance intent:
- Contract is explicit enough that a failing response can be categorized as: format violation (non-JSON prefix/shape), schema violation (JSON shape/type mismatch), or semantic-reference violation (unknown IDs/files).

### 15.3 Step 3: Harden Provider Parser Pipeline (Executed)

Provider parser behavior is now unified behind a shared staged fallback helper in the core LLM module.

Implemented behavior:
- Shared staged parse pipeline in `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/mod.rs`:
  1. Direct JSON parse of the full trimmed response
  2. Markdown-fence extraction (` ```json ... ``` ` and bare fenced blocks)
  3. Embedded-object extraction from mixed prose/JSON text using bounded candidate scanning and balanced JSON boundary detection
- Provider-specific `parse_json_response` helpers in OpenAI, OpenRouter, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, and Anthropic now delegate to the shared parser helper instead of maintaining divergent local logic.
- Parse failures now include parse-stage tags in the error message (`direct_json`, `fenced_json`, `embedded_json`) so failures can be categorized without inspecting provider-specific code paths.
- Compatibility `strip_markdown_json` helpers remain test-visible for provider unit tests, but runtime parsing no longer depends on duplicated fence-only logic.

Deliberate non-goal for this step:
- The bounded retry / re-ask policy remains deferred to Step 15.5. Step 15.3 stops at deterministic local parse recovery; it does not trigger additional provider round-trips.

Touchpoints to focus efforts:
- `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/openai.rs` (`parse_json_response`, `strip_markdown_json`)
- `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/openrouter.rs` (`parse_json_response`, `strip_markdown_json`)
- `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/github_copilot.rs` (`parse_json_response`, `strip_markdown_json`)
- `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/gemini.rs` (`parse_json_response`, `strip_markdown_json`)
- `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/anthropic.rs` (`parse_json_response`, `strip_markdown_json`)
- Shared helper target: `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/mod.rs`

Acceptance intent:
- A prose-prefixed fenced JSON response is recoverable by parser fallback, while malformed or schema-incompatible content still fails deterministically.

### 15.4 Step 4: Preserve Semantic Safety During Apply (Executed)

The lenient refinement apply path now preserves strict semantic safety while surfacing machine-readable repair/drop diagnostics.

Implemented behavior:
- Strict semantic invariants remain enforced in `validate_refinement` / `apply_refinement` for unknown IDs, invalid file membership, incomplete splits, and bad reclassifications.
- `apply_refinement_lenient` still follows repair-first, drop-invalid-second semantics:
  1. `repair_refinement_response` rewrites likely name-for-ID substitutions
  2. `sanitize_refinement_response` removes any residual invalid operations
  3. `apply_refinement` runs only on the sanitized operation set
- Warning construction is now standardized in `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/refinement.rs` through shared helper paths for repaired and dropped operations.
- Each warning now exposes:
  - stable event type classification (`refinement.warning.repaired`, `refinement.warning.dropped`)
  - structured audit payload content suitable for logs and UI activity streams
  - normalized human-readable messages that encode whether an op was repaired or dropped
- Tauri refinement job activity now emits these warnings with event-type and payload data, and dropped operations are surfaced at warning level rather than being indistinguishable from repairs.
- CLI warning output now uses the same standardized event tags, keeping fallback diagnostics aligned between desktop and CLI flows.

Fallback rule retained:
- If sanitized apply still fails unexpectedly, refinement falls back to deterministic groups instead of returning partially corrupted grouping state.

Touchpoints to focus efforts:
- `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/refinement.rs` (`apply_refinement_lenient`, `repair_refinement_response`, `sanitize_refinement_response`, `apply_refinement`)
- `crates/diffcore-tauri/src/commands/llm.rs` (`RefinementResult.warnings`, activity stream emission for repair/drop)
- `crates/diffcore-cli/src/main.rs` (warning output on lenient apply)

Acceptance intent:
- Invalid individual operations do not abort whole refinement unless all operations are unusable; baseline deterministic grouping remains safe.

### 15.5 Step 5: Align Retry/Iteration Policy and Fallback UX (Executed)

Retry/iteration behavior is now centralized and deterministic across CLI and Tauri.

Implemented behavior:
- Shared bounded runtime loop in `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/refinement.rs` via `run_refinement_iterations`.
- `llm.refinement.max_iterations` is now treated as a total provider-attempt budget (`>= 1`), not just an ad-hoc parse retry knob.
- Parse failures consume attempt budget and retry until exhausted; exhaustion yields deterministic fallback with warning payloads and retained deterministic groups.
- Successful responses can run for multiple iterations (bounded by `max_iterations`) by rebuilding each request from the latest refined group state.
- Runtime stop conditions are explicit and surfaced as machine-readable metadata:
  - `no_op`
  - `no_score_gain`
  - `max_iterations_reached`
  - `parse_retries_exhausted`
  - `provider_failure`
- CLI and both Tauri refinement paths now delegate to the same core loop, eliminating previous divergence.
- Tauri `RefinementResult` now includes `stop_reason`, `attempts_used`, and `parse_failures`; fallback remains non-fatal and user-visible via toast/activity messaging.

Touchpoints updated:
- `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/refinement.rs` (shared iteration runtime + stop reasons + fallback outcome)
- `crates/diffcore-cli/src/main.rs` (`run_refinement` now consumes shared outcome)
- `crates/diffcore-tauri/src/commands/llm.rs` (streaming and non-streaming refinement parity)
- `crates/diffcore-tauri/ui/src/App.tsx` (non-disruptive fallback toast messaging)
- `crates/diffcore-tauri/ui/src/types.ts` (stop metadata fields)

Acceptance status:
- Retry and iteration behavior is now bounded, deterministic, and consistent across surfaces.
- Refinement failures preserve a usable deterministic result and surface fallback context without hard-failing the UX.

### 15.6 Step 6: Add Regression Matrix and Rollout Gates

Protect improvements with targeted tests and explicit rollout checkpoints.

Planned changes:
- Add parser regression cases for:
  - prose prefix + fenced JSON
  - prose prefix + bare JSON object
  - multiple JSON blocks with first invalid and later valid
  - trailing prose after valid JSON
- Add integration checks for Tauri/CLI fallback parity and warning propagation.
- Add rollout gates requiring parser and apply-layer coverage before enabling new provider behaviors by default.

Touchpoints to focus efforts:
- Provider test modules in:
  - `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/openai.rs`
  - `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/openrouter.rs`
  - `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/github_copilot.rs`
  - `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/gemini.rs`
  - `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/anthropic.rs`
- Refinement apply tests in `crates/diffcore-core/src/llm/refinement.rs`
- Command-level behavior tests in:
  - `crates/diffcore-cli/src/main.rs`
  - `crates/diffcore-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs`

Acceptance intent:
- The specific real-world parse failure class is permanently covered by automated tests, and future parser changes cannot regress silently.
